The class "Spatio-temporal models for ecologists (using Template Model Builder)" will be starting at UW March 27th, Tues 9-10:20 and Thur 9-11:30 for 11 weeks (see syllabus below).  We will have materials online (using GitHub), broadcast using GoToMeeting, and will aim to record all lectures as well.  We welcome attendees off-site although we cannot promise much support, so we encourage people to work in teams off-site to resolve any questions.  If you'd like to receive emails for instructions to attend offsite, please add your email at:

Also, presentations are now available online for the CAPAM mini-workshop on spatio-temporal models (http://www.capamresearch.org/Spatio-Temporal-Modelling-Mini-Workshop/presentations).  We had a tremendous group of speakers, check them out!

Finally, we are planning a special issue at Fisheries Research for papers regarding spatio-temporal analysis of fishery-dependent (or other opportunistic) data.  Please email Mark Maunder (mmaunder@iattc.org) and me if you're interested.

COURSE BACKGROUND
Ecology grew as a field to explain common spatial patterns in ecosystem structure and function.  Since its birth, ecology has asked questions arising at broad spatial scales (e.g., why are some pairs of species not observed together in any island ecosystem).  More recently, ecologists have developed statistical methods to separate signal (e.g., species competition in island communities) from random noise (e.g., null models for species co-occurrence).  Therefore, there is continuing growth in methods and their interpretation to account for spatial patterns in both ecological processes and in unexplained noise.  However, spatial statistical methods can seem intimidating without reliable tools for their development and a clear understanding of their interpretation and application. 

COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course aims to develop applied skills for ecologists to understand, interpret, apply, and develop new models for spatial patterns in species and communities (whether marine, terrestrial, or human).  In particular, students will learn to use a “mixed-effects models” which combine fixed effects (representing ecological relationships) and random effects (representing spatially structured errors).  These mixed-effect models will then be used to develop models for spatial variation and how such variation can evolve over time.  Students will develop these spatio-temporal models by progressively adding complexity to simple linear models.  Throughout, the course will focus on a minimal toolbox to bridge between simple linear and complex spatio-temporal models. Students would be encouraged to develop an advanced understanding about the appropriate use of such approaches; namely, their correct application and their interpretation in natural sciences.

LEARNING GOALS

1.	Apply understanding of statistical background for mixed-effects models, including statistical properties (consistency, bias, and estimating precision), when interpreting results from simulation experiments
2.	Analyze spatial and spatio-temporal processes using descriptive tools including semi-variance, additive covariance functions, and separable covariance functions
3.	Modify existing and create new code using R and Template Model Builder to implement linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models including spatial and temporal covariance.
4.	Differentiate between the appropriate use of spatial and spatio-temporal modelling in the separation of process from spatially correlated noise.
5.	Create new spatio-temporal models for use in simulation experiments, and analyze a real-world dataset of the students’ choosing.
