A few updates since my last email in March:

The UW class "Spatio-temporal models for ecologists" is wrapping up.  All presentations are online, and recordings are also available here: https://github.com/James-Thorson/2018_FSH556.  Its a good resource to learn about the statistical basis for spatio-temporal models.

A new paper shows benefits to developing age/length composition data for stock assessments using spatio-temporal models:  http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2018-0015#.WwbehPkvyUk.  I still compile all reports and papers that use FishStats (https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/wiki/Applications), so please email me if you have one to add.

Colleagues and I have three spatio-temporal post-docs to announce:
1. Model testing for new size-structured snow crab population, based in Seattle and funded for 1 year (potential to extend based on performance).  Please email Jim Thorson (James.Thorson@noaa.gov) for details.
2. Model development for combining multiple data sources in the Eastern Bering Sea to predict environmental impacts on distribution, based in Seattle and funded for 2 years.   Please email Stan Kotwicki (stan.kotwicki@noaa.gov) and Jim Thorson (James.Thorson@noaa.gov) for details.
3. Analysis of species interactions using bird communities, based in Finland and funded for 2.5 years.  Please see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKDRxyRxjv8g7Z-5FYjS46V0phAdxXRl/view?usp=sharing for how to apply.
All positions are suitable for motivated Ph.D. graduates with experience in R, strong statistical background, and experience in applied ecology.  We can develop skills in TMB and spatio-temporal methods during the position.
