I have two updates to regarding FishStats:

1.  A new R package for a Multispecies Interactions Spatio-temporal (MIST) model is now public at www.FishStats.org, and is described in Thorson Munch Swain (2017) Ecology, abstract [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1760/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle).  This biomass-dynamic model allows estimates of (1) local asymmetric impacts of each species on per-capita productivity of other species, (2) symmetric covariance to shared environmental drivers, and (3) fishing impacts using spatial harvest information. It has identical input/output, plotting, and Rmarkdown tutorial as other FishStats packages.

2.  The first FishStats training workshop is next week.  We have a full room, but people can attend remotely using details below.  Please contact Sarah Stein with any connection questions.  I'll post recordings of the workshop and presentation slides later this month.
