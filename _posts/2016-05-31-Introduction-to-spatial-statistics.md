FishStats uses Template Model Builder and modern statistical techniques to rapidly estimate biological parameters (fixed effects) and spatial correlations (via inclusion of random effects) when analyzing real-world data.  The techniques are relatively new, and not well documented in any single textbook or paper.  For interested students, I recommend reading class materials from a [Spring 2016 UW course](http://github.com/James-Thorson/2016_Spatio-temporal_models) "Spatio-temporal mdoels for ecologists".  Materials include:

1.  Recorded lectures
2.  Example code in TMB and R
3.  Homework assignments and solutions

These materials will eventually be distributed as a textbook, so please do not reproduce them without permission from [James Thorson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxaalYEAAAAJ&hl=en)
