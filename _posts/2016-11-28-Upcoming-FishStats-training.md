There will be three upcoming opportunities to learn about the spatio-temporal tools for estimating fish abundance, habitat associations, and species interactions using tools at www.FishStats.org:

1.  A 2-hour hands-on tutorial at the UW Think Tank, tomorrow Nov. 29 at 9-11am PST in FSH 203 (abstract below).  If you'd like to attend remotely, please go to www.GoToMeeting.com and click "Join a Meeting," and enter using Meeting ID #242-434-181

2.  A 1-hour QUEST overview of recent research and papers, Dec. 15 at 10-11am PST.  I'll send out offsite attendance information closer to the date.

3.  A 1-week long training to use FishStats for index standardization, spatial dynamic factor analysis, fishery-dependent standardization with targeting, and ecosystem analysis using VAST and SpatialVAM, Feb 20-24 at AFSC.  Jin Gao will be TA, and we will encourage people to attend with data sets.  I'll again send out attendance info later.

I hope to keep improving our user- and training-resources, and welcome feedback.

Think Tank Abstract:  
Collaborators and I have been developing, testing, and documenting spatio-temporal models and software for single- and multi-species analysis of fishery and/or survey data.  R packages for implementing these models are now publicly available and documented through www.FishStats.org, a spatio-temporal toolbox for fisheries science. 

In this Think Tank, I will present a small number of slides (<15 total) to recap recent model developments and applications.  I will then lead a discussion of different applications for which FishStats could be useful in 2017 stock assessments, e.g., estimating survey indices, standardizing fishery catch rates, estimating distribution shifts or range expansion/contraction, or identifying multispecies associations.  With input from attendees, I will then provide a semi-structured, hands-on demonstration of how different modelling goals can be achieved.

I encourage attendees to bring a laptop and to install a recent version of R (e.g., 3.3.1) and appropriate Rtools (if using a windows OS).  Attendees will install other necessary software (including INLA and TMB) as we go through tutorials together.
