FishStats compiles different tools for harmonizing data for marine fishes worldwide, analyzing data to estimate abundance, distribution shift, range expansion, and spatial overlap, and also visualize results.  Recent additions to linked tools include:

1.  a markdown tutorial for single-species models [SpatialDeltaGLMM tutorial](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/blob/master/examples/SpatialDeltaGLMM_example.pdf).  SpatialDeltaGLMM can now calculate range expansion/contraction (from a new ProcB paper), as well as distribution shifts (from a MEE paper), in addition to previous abundance-index estimates.

2.  a markdown tutorial for a multispecies model (VAST tutorial).   VAST is identical to SpatialDeltaGLMM for single-species data (including indices, range shift, and range expansion metrics), but can also estimate community dynamics via spatial dynamic factor analysis (from a Global Ecology Biogreography paper), or control for fisher targeting using multispecies fishery data to estimate abundance (from a CJFAS paper).  

3.  FishViz visualizes model output from SpatialDeltaGLMM applied to fishery data fishery data for >400 species in 15 regions worldwide at www.FishViz.org (including all groundfishes in Alaska and West Coast regions).  

4.  FishStats now has a listserv (https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fishstats-listserv)
